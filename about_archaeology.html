            <h2>What is Archaeology</h2>
            <p>Archaeology is the study of human past activity by analysis of artifacts, sites, and other remains. Instead of relying solely on written records or historic accounts, understanding how these physical remains fit into the broader human story archaeology provides a distinctive way to deepen our understanding of human culture, change over time, and the diverse experiences of people in the past.</p>

                <summary>Types of Archeology</summary>
                <p>At its heart, archaeology is interdisciplinary: it draws on methods from anthropology, history, geology, biology, chemistry, and more. For example, archaeologists may study plant or animal remains (ecofacts) to understand diet or environment, stone tools (lithics) to investigate technology, or structural remains to explore social organization. They also emphasize the importance of context — the spatial and relational position of artifacts and features within a site. When an artifact is removed without documenting its exact location, its context is lost forever. That means archaeology is not just about collecting objects, but about carefully recording the details of an artifacts location and analyzing its relationship to its surroundings.</p>

                <summary>Archaeological Sites</summary>
                <p>An archaeological site is any place where there are physical remains of past human activities. Sites of archaeological investigation vary widely: they might be prehistoric campsites with no written record, or more recent historic urban ruins. They may vary in size, from the remains of a prehistoric campfire, to the site of a historic battlefield, to the ruins of an ancient city.</p>

                <summary>Do Archaeologists Study Dinosaurs?</summary>
                <p>No. Scientists who study dinosaurs are called paleontologists. Paleontoligists study the history of life on earth though fossils, including dinosaurs, animals, plants, and ven bacteria. Since both paleontologists and archaeologists study physical remains, they have a lot in common; they may even work together! Humans have been living with animals, such as dogs or livestock, for a long time. Even before that, ancient hunters were following specific prey, such as the wooly mammoth. Sometimes, studying animal remains can help archaeologists understand more about the relationships people has with them in the past. However, dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago, far before our earlist ancestors. So, dinosaurs fossils aren't usually helpful to archaeologists, unless the bones were used by humans.</p>
