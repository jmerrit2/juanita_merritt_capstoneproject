            <h2>Archaeofacts: Stop-Motion Animation Project (SMAP)</h2>
            <p>The Waring Center is collaborating with faculty and students in the UWG Art Program to bring archaeology to life for kids in a fun animated way through a project called Archaeofacts. This project uses stop-motion animation, the animation style used in Gumby and Kubo and the Two Strings, to bring lessons about archaeology and anthropology to children of all ages.</p>
            <p>While the first videos, or episodes, in this series are still in development, we hope you will check back in the near future to see the final product! These videos will be a free resource for educators to bring archaeology to their classroom in a fun and exciting way.</p>
