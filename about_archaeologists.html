            <h2>What Do Archaeologists Do?</h2>
            <p>Archaeologists study the human past by examining the physical traces people left behind — everything from tools and pottery to buildings, landscapes, and even ancient trash. Their goal is to understand how people lived, worked, and interacted with their environment. Rather than just collecting artifacts, archaeologists analyze context — the exact location and relationships among objects, soil layers, and features — because this helps reconstruct how a site was used and what it reveals about past societies.</p>

                <summary>Finding Archaeological Sites</summary>
                <p>There are many ways to find a site, including written or oral records, ground surveys, using satellites, and sometimes even completely by accidents. There are also predictive models that analyze factors like distance from water, ground steepness, soil type, and other factors that influence where people settle or perform certain tasks. After conducting a survey, archaeologists need to evaluate the site's significance. Maybe there was no site. Maybe the site wasn't significant as determined by law. However, if the site was significant, further excavations may be planed.</p>

                <summary>Collecting Data</summary>
                <p>Doing excavations is only a small part of an archaeologist's work. Archeology is a destructive science, meaning that once a site has been disturbed, it can't be recreated. As a result, archaeologists must be thorough when doing research and collecting data. First, that must make detailed research plans and seek approval from the government to do an excavation. Next, before nay diging takes place, they grid the site, meaning they superimpose a grid over the site and carefully measure and identify each square. During the excavation, archaeologists must record the exact location of each artifact, both by the location on the grid and the depth in the soil.</p>

                <summary>Labwork</summary>
                <p>After fieldwork, archaeologists spend considerable time in the laboratory, cleaning, cataloging, and analyzing artifacts. They might use radiocarbon dating to estimate an object's age, study animal bones to understand diet, or analyze soil samples for evidence of ancient crops or climate conditions. They also interpret their findings in light of broader anthropological or historical questions, such as how trade networks developed or how social hierarchies changed over time.</p>
