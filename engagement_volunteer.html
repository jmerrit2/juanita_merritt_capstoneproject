            <h2>The Lewis H. Larson Volunteer Program</h2>
            <p>The Lewis H. Larson, Jr. Volunteer Program is a continuous program, allowing volunteers to work along-side the professional staff and faculty in the Anthropology Program, the Biological and Forensic Anthropology Lab (BAFAL) and the Waring Center on a wide range of projects that provide hands-on experience. Volunteers can work with Physical Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Anthropological Archaeology, and more. If you are interested in anthropology, like to organize, teach, work with computers, and meet new people, then volunteering might be for you! Volunteers at the Waring Center handle real artifacts from sites across the Southeastern United States. Volunteers are also eligible to take various practical workshops, provided through the Larson Volunteer Program, to teach methods of curation and excavation. Additionally, the Lewis H. Larson, Jr. Medal Reward Program offers incentives and allows the staff to thank volunteers for their work invested.</p>
