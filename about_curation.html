            <h2>What is Curation?</h2>
            <p>In archaeology, curation refers to the processes and practices involved in preserving, organizing, documenting, and providing access to the material and documentary remains from archaeological fieldwork: artifacts, ecofacts, samples, records, photographs, maps, databases, and so on. After the excavation or survey phase ends, the resulting collections dont simply get boxed up and forgotten; rather, they become part of a curated repository where long-term stewardship is critical.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Types of Repositories</summary>
                <p>Collections are stored at repositories, of which there are different kinds. If you've ever been to a history museum, you may have been to a repository. Museums are repositories with exhibit space. Exhibits are both a way to present curated collection to the public and a way to make money to fund curation. Usually, the artifacts seen in an exhibit are only a small portion of the items in a repository. Many repositories do not have exhibit space; these types of repositories are often on university campuses. They may loan artifacts to museum exhibits.</p>

                <summary>The Curation Process</summary>
                <p>Curation involves several steps. When a repository takes a collection, they must first ensure that the collection is in good condition and has enough information to connect it to its context. This may involve cataloging and stabilizing the artifacts, and compiling and organizing the data. The repository will most likely have a database to store and manage metadata. After the repository takes the collection, they must continue to provide physical care to the artifacts. Artifacts need to be stored in a way that protects them from physical damage, and from environmental damage, such as from humidity, temperature, or pests. Finally, curation must involve accessibility and re-use: collections should be accessible to researchers, descendant communities, educational users, and sometimes the public.</p>
