            <h2>PK-12 Programming and Activities</h2>
            <p>The Waring Center provides programming, with accompanying hands-on experiential learning activities, for PK-12 classes. We work with educators to design our presentations on topics that tie directly to the Georgia Standards of Excellence so that curricular needs are met while also introducing students to new topics, concepts, and materials related to archaeology. To this point, archaeology is one of those disciplines that can speak to numerous different curricular areas outside of archaeology, anthropology, and history. We have worked with educators in many areas ranging from biology to physics to economics to environmental science.</p>
