            <h2>Collecting and Looting</h2>
            <p>Looting and vandalism are two major challenges that threaten archaeological sites, and understanding them is essential for anyone studying or teaching about archaeology.</p>
            <h3>Looting</h3>
            <p>Looting refers to the unauthorized removal of artifacts or materials from an archaeological site. People may loot for profit, personal curiosity, or even out of a desire to collect pieces of the past. However, when objects are taken without proper documentation, their context—the exact location and relationship to other finds—is destroyed. This context is what gives artifacts their scientific and historical meaning. Without it, archaeologists lose critical information about how people lived, what they believed, and how societies changed over time</p>
            <h3>Vandalism</h3>
            <p>Vandalism involves the intentional defacement or destruction of archaeological features, objects, or landscapes. This might include graffiti, digging, breaking structures, or other acts that physically damage the site. Sometimes vandalism is deliberate, while other times it results from a lack of awareness—for example, visitors walking over fragile areas or handling artifacts without realizing the impact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's important to note that discussions of looting and vandalism arn't just about blame but about stewardship—it's our shared responsibility to care for cultural resources. Archaeological sites are nonrenewable; once they are disturbed, the knowledge they hold cannot be replaced. Educating the public, involving local and descendant communities, and promoting respectful visitation are positive ways to protect and celebrate our shared heritage.</p>
