            <h2>Bringing Classes to the Center</h2>
            <p>We invite you to bring your class to the Waring Center! We can provide any of the above activities at the Center, but you can also experience lab tours and learn to become an archaeologist yourself by digging in our mock excavation pit.</p>
            <h3>Lab Tours</h3>
            <p>We provide guided tours of the laboratory facility to show visitors where our operations take place and give them a taste of what we do at the Waring Center. This involves showing them the curation work area, where students talk about the types of curation projects they are working on; the curation stacks, where the collections get stored/curated; and the research room, where we have active projects in community engagement, VR, digitization, and experimental archaeology.</p>
            <h3>Mock Excavation Pit</h3>
            <p>Archaeology is known as a down-in-the-dirt discipline, which fascinates many people because you can literally dig anywhere and have the potential to find something hidden just beneath the surface. The Waring Center has a large mock excavation pit to teach visitors the methods of field archaeology in a fun, hands-on mini workshop on how to dig like an archaeologist. Hidden just beneath the surface in this pit is a reconstructed historic home site for visitors to find, complete with replica pottery, tools, and even a collapsed chimney!</p>
